The LSXO and HSXO on the test chip will perform poorly unless the
crystals and their load caps are placed close to the package pins
where the crystal inputs and outputs are located.  The existing
M.2 daughtercard for the chipIgnite development board does not
have pads for additional components.

This alternative daughter card is specifically for use with this
project and has pads for the low speed (32kHz) crystal on the
front side (X2), and pads for a surface mount high-speed crystal
(8-16 MHz) on the back side (X1) with a footprint that will
accommodate several sizes (2x1.6, 2.5x2, or 3.2x2.5).  For the
lower speeds (4 and 6 MHz), an additonal through-hole mount
(X3) is provided (requires zero-ohm resistors on JP1 and JP2).

Thanks to Brady Etz (who designed the LSXO for Chipalooza) for
the daughterboard design.
